Data Analysis
•	After combining and cleaning the datasets we found that we will be working further with 39,170 students across 15 reputed schools.

•	All the top performing schools are charter schools! Further analysis reveals that charter schools look like better performers at the first glance but if we dig deeper, we can see that they have smaller student size than public schools. Smaller the size of the school better the performance which we can see while reorganizing schools by number of students:

•	In our opinion spending more on each student did not help to bring up the desired outcomes academically:
